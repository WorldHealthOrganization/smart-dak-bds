### Summary 
Congenital anomalies, also known as birth defects, are structural or functional abnormalities, including metabolic disorders, that are present at birth. Surveillance of these conditions is critical so that countries can prioritize, plan and provide prevention, treatment and support services. WHO’s SMART guidelines initiative approach, which empowers countries to integrate recommended clinical and public health practices, and data recommendations into digital systems, has been applied to Birth Defects Surveillance (BDS) and its five-step pathway to advance the adoption of best clinical and data practices for Birth Defects Surveillance (BDS) is presented below.

### L1 Narrative guidelines
To guide national birth defects surveillance programmes, WHO has created a toolkit of guidelines, recommendations, manuals, training materials and guidance. This toolkit informed the development of the digital adaptation kit for Birth Defects Surveillance (DAK for BDS). The WHO "Birth defects surveillance: A manual for programme managers" can be found [here](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/337425). The WHO "Birth defects surveillance: Quick reference handbook of selected congenital anomalies and infections" can be found [here](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/338485). And the WHO's "Birth defects surveillance training: Facilitator’s guide" can be found [here](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240099913).

### L2 Operational guidelines
Digital adaptation kits are designed to facilitate the accurate reflection of WHO’s clinical, public health and data use guidelines within the digital systems countries are adopting. DAKs are operational, software-agnostic, standardized documentation that distil clinical, public health and data use guidance into a format that can be transparently incorporated into digital systems. DAKs serve as a prerequisite for developing computable, or machine-readable, guidelines, as well as executable reference software and advanced analytics for precision health.
