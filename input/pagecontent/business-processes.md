This page describes the business processes included in the WHO Digital
Adaptation Kit (DAK) for Birth Defects Surveillance (BDS).

A business process, or process, is a set of related activities or tasks 
performed together to achieve the objectives of the health programme area, 
such as registration, counselling, referrals. Workflows are a visual 
representation of the progression of activities (tasks, events, interactions) 
that are performed within the business process. The workflow provides a “story” 
for the business process being diagrammed and is used to enhance communication 
and collaboration among users, stakeholders and engineers. The workflows included in this DAK depict processes that have been generalized across different contexts and may not reflect the variability and nuances across different settings. The simplicity of the workflow may not adequately illustrate the nonlinear steps that may occur.

The DAK for BDS focuses on key business processes involved in birth defects surveillance including the identification of birth defects, the confirmation of diagnosis and aggregation of surveillance data.

### Overview of Key Business Processes
