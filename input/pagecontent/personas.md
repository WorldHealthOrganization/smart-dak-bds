A persona is a depiction of a relevant stakeholder, or end user, of the system.
Although the specific roles and demographic profiles of the personas will vary depending on the setting, generic personas are based on WHO core competencies and credentials of different health worker personas.

### Targeted generic personas

 The targeted personas for the WHO DAK for birth defects surveillance are data collectors, birth defects specialists,surveillance programme managers, data managers and surveillance data managers that are able to provide the required essential data for birth defect surveillance. The key competences of these groups are defined by WHO in the Table 3 of the DAK.

### Related personas
In addition to the targeted personas detailed in Table 3, there may be value in exploring other health worker occupational groups and stakeholders within the context of birth defects surveillance, such as newborn, mother or informant. Additional related personas are listed in the Table 4 of the DAK.
